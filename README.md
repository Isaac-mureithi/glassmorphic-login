This project is a modern, user-focused login interface that demonstrates my ability to translate UX design principles into practical frontend development.

🎨 DESIGN GOALS: 
- Minimalistic UI - focused on clarity and functionality.
- Glassmorphism - use of transparency and blur effects to elevate visual design.
- Custom Styling - dynamic input fields with hover and focus states to enhance interaction.
  

🛠️ BUILT WITH:
- 📄 HTML for semantic and structured content.  
- 📄 CSS for layout, effects, and responsive design.
- 🖼️ Boxicons: Lightweight icons for an aesthetic touch.
  

✨ LEARNINGS/OUTCOMES:
1. Blending design with code allowed me to translate user interface concepts into clean, maintainable code.
2. Applying responsive design ensured usability across screen sizes.
3. Utilizing CSS effects enabled me to intergrate advanced styling techniques like glassmorphism.
