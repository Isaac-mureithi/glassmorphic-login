This repository demonstrates a responsive login interface created with HTML and CSS, showcasing my translation of UX design principles to hands-on frontend development. This project emphasizes the intersection of form and functionality, with a focus on creating user-friendly UI that scale beautifully across devices. 


🎨 DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS: 
- Minimalistic UI: Focuses on clarity and functionality.
- Glassmorphism: Uses transparency and blur effects to elevate visual design.
- Custom Styling: Dynamic input fields with hover and focus states enhance interaction.
  

🛠️ BUILT WITH:

├── 📄 HTML for semantic and structured content.  
├── 📄 CSS for layout, effects, and responsive design.
├── 🖼️ Boxicons: Lightweight icons for an aesthetic touch.
└── 🖼️ Background image.


✨ KEY LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1. Blending design with code allows me to translate user interface concepts into clean, maintainable code.
2. Applying responsive design ensures usability across screen sizes.
3. Utilizing CSS effects enables me to intergrate advanced styling techniques like glassmorphism.



🌱 As a UX designer learning frontend development, I aim to bridge the gap between design and engineering, bringing creativity and functionality to life in user interfaces.
